\# üêß Day 9 ‚Äî Process Management POC



---



\## üéØ Objective



Master Linux process control by:



\- Viewing and analyzing system processes  

\- Controlling foreground and background jobs  

\- Killing or pausing processes  

\- Adjusting process priorities  

\- Simulating real-world scenarios like runaway CPU tasks  

\- Automating top process analysis with a shell script
